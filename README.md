## Usage

Upon loading the application, the user is presented with a random set of 200 generated users. The user can search by name utilizing the search bar at the top. Upon submitting a search, the data set will be filtered by names including the search term. To clear the search, an empty search can be submitted. At any point, the user may click on the "Name" heading to sort the list by first name. If the list will default to ascending order on the first click, and alternate between ascending and descending upon further clicks. The application can very easily be adapted to grab a different data set using the axios API call.
